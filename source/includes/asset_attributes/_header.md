# Asset Attributes

Asset Attributes can include things like colour, material, and size, and are linked to Catalogue Items. 

They can be static, i.e. only have one possible value, or dynamic, having multiple possible values, e.g. a colour attribute that can be either blue or black for a Catalogue Item.
