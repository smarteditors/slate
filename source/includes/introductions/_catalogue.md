# Catalogue API Introduction

Catalogue API endpoints deal with the categorisation of Items in the Asset API.

Catalogue API classes consist of increasingly granular kinds in the heirarchy: 

Catalogue > Category > Type > Catalogue Item

Items in the Asset API are phsical items, such a chair in an office, and they all belong to a Catalogue Item.
